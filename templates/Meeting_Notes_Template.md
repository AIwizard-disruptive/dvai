## 💡 Tips for Best AI Extraction

1. **Be specific about owners**: Use full names or email addresses
2. **Use clear dates**: "by Friday Dec 15" or "by 2025-12-15" work better than "soon"
3. **Quote decisions**: Direct quotes help AI understand context
4. **Mark priorities**: Use "urgent", "high priority" for important items
5. **Include context**: Why decisions were made helps with search later
6. **Use consistent formatting**: Helps AI parse structure
7. **Separate topics**: Use clear headings for different discussion areas
